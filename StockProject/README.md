# Stock Market Portfolio Simulation and Analysis
First project is the Stock Project, which just takes a look at a collection of stocks, returns Open/Close prices, Volumes, Market Cap, 50 and 200 day EMA.
The project also features a time series analysis using autocorrelation - This lags the data a day behind and compares the adj closes price to that of the day before in order to give an accurate prediction on whether or not the stock will trend the same way the next day.
Lastly this Project includes a Monte Carlo Simulation of my own personal portfolio
